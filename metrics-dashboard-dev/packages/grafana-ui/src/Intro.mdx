# Metrics Dashboard React Components

With @grafana/ui, we want to democratize development. This library of reusable Metrics Dashboard components and guidelines should help you with contribution and plugin development.

## Our vision

We started @grafana/ui to make contributing to Metrics Dashboard as easy as possible for community members of all fields. We want to create a component library that results in:

- Understanding of how each component works and how you can use it to create a great user experience.
- Short development times and consistent code quality.
- A beautiful, visually consistent Metrics Dashboard experience.
- Transparency about how we work and what we do.

### How to get involved

When we notice that we need to change something, we determine together what the change should be, then we put the change in place and communicate it publicly. Developers and designers create and improve @grafana/ui together. Throughout the process, we strive to involve you and meet your needs.

## Get started

- **Explore UI components**
  Click on any of the components in the sidebar to see how they look, and how to configure them. Each component contains documentation of its properties, as well as code examples for how to use it.
- **Try them out**
  - Experiment with different properties, by clicking on each component story.
  - Change the properties under **Controls** in the side panel.
- **Use them**
  Once you've found the right component for your use case, click the **Code** tab to see the code implementation, or look at examples under **Docs**.

  For more details, refer to the package source.

## Installation

`yarn add @grafana/ui`

`npm install @grafana/ui`
