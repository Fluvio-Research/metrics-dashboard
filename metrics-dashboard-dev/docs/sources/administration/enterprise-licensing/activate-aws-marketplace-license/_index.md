# Activate a Metrics Dashboard Enterprise license purchased through AWS Marketplace

AWS Marketplace is a convenient place for AWS customers to buy and manage a license for Metrics Dashboard Enterprise versions 8.3.0 and later.

{{< section >}}

You can deploy Metrics Dashboard Enterprise in the following ways:

- Using AWS services like ECS, EKS or EC2.
- In an instance outside AWS.

In each case, you must activate the Metrics Dashboard Enterprise license purchased in AWS Marketplace to take advantage of Metrics Dashboard Enterprise observability features. Metrics Dashboard Enterprise licenses purchased through AWS Marketplace are subject to the same [restrictions](../#license-restrictions) as Metrics Dashboard Enterprise licensed purchased directly from Metrics Dashboard Labs.

> To purchase a license directly from Metrics Dashboard Labs or learn more about other Metrics Dashboard offerings, [Contact a Metrics Dashboard Labs representative](/contact?about=metrics-dashboard-enterprise).

## Before you begin

Become an AWS customer. Only AWS customers have access to purchase services through AWS Marketplace. To learn more about becoming an AWS customer, refer to [Sign up for AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start).
