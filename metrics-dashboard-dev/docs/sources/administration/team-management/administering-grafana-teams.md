# Administer Metrics Dashboard Teams

This topic describes how to administer Metrics Dashboard Teams.

## View a list of Teams

See the complete list of teams in your Metrics Dashboard organization.

To view a list of teams:

1. Sign in to Metrics Dashboard as an organization administrator or a team administrator.
1. Click the arrow next to **Administration** in the left-side menu, click **Users and access**, and select **Teams**.

The role you use to sign in to Metrics Dashboard determines how you see Teams lists.

## Teams best practices

Metrics Dashboard recommends you use Teams to organize and manage access to Metrics Dashboardâ€™s core resources, such as dashboards and alerts. Teams is an easy organizational tool to manage, and allows flexible sharing between teams.

Metrics Dashboard recommends that you use Instances or Stacks to separate Teams if you want true isolation, to ensure that no information leaks between Teams. You can synchronize some resources between instances using provisioning.

## Secure Metrics Dashboard Teams

The most important thing to consider for securing Teams is to only grant team administrator rights to the users you trust to administer the Team.
