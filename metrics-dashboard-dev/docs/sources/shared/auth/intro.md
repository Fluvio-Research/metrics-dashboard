There are numerous authentication methods available in Metrics Dashboard to verify user identity. The authentication configuration dictates which users can access Metrics Dashboard and the methods they can use for logging in.
You can also configure Metrics Dashboard to automatically update users' roles and team memberships in Metrics Dashboard based on the information returned by the auth provider integration.

When deciding on an authentication method, it's important to take into account your current identity and access management system as well as the specific authentication and authorization features you require.
For a complete list of the available authentication options and the features they support, refer to [Configure authentication](/docs/metrics-dashboard/<METRICS_DASHBOARD_VERSION>/setup-metrics-dashboard/configure-security/configure-authentication).
