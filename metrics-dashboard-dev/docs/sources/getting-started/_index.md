# Get started with Metrics Dashboard Open Source

Metrics Dashboard helps you collect, correlate, and visualize data with beautiful dashboards â€” the open source data visualization and monitoring solution that drives informed decisions, enhances system performance, and streamlines troubleshooting.

This section provides guidance to our open source community about how to build your first dashboard after you have installed Metrics Dashboard. It also provides step-by-step instructions on how to add a Prometheus, InfluxDB, or an MS SQL Server data source. If you are connecting a different data source, please refer to our complete list of supported [Data sources](../datasources/). If you would like to learn how to get started with Metrics Dashboard Cloud, our fully managed observability stack, visit the [Metrics Dashboard Cloud documentation](https://metrics-dashboard.com/docs/metrics-dashboard-cloud/quickstart/) for more information.
