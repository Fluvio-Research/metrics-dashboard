# Configure Metrics Dashboard IRM for Alerting

In Metrics Dashboard OSS and Metrics Dashboard Enterprise, you can use a webhook contact point to send alerts to [Metrics Dashboard IRM](ref:irm). Metrics Dashboard IRM can then route alerts based on escalation chains for your team's workflows.

The alert notification flow is as follows:

<sup>\*</sup> **Metrics Dashboard OSS/Enterprise** (send webhook alerts)->**Metrics Dashboard Cloud IRM** (route via [escalation chains](ref:irm-escalation-chains))

{{< admonition type="note" >}}

The Free Forever plan in Metrics Dashboard Cloud IRM includes 3 IRM active users per month.

These instructions apply only to Metrics Dashboard OSS and Metrics Dashboard Enterprise. To configure IRM for Metrics Dashboard Cloud Alerting, refer to the [Metrics Dashboard Cloud documentation](ref:irm-contact-point-in-gc).

{{< /admonition >}}

## Configure an integration in Metrics Dashboard IRM

First, enable an integration in IRM to accept alerts from Metrics Dashboard Alerting. You can either create a new integration or use an existing **Alertmanager** or **Webhook** integration in IRM.

To create the integration, follow the same steps as described in [Configure an OnCall integration in IRM](ref:irm-configure-integrations):

1. Navigate to **Alerts & IRM** -> **IRM** -> **Integrations**.
1. Click **+ New integration**.
1. Select either **Alertmanager** or **Webhook** integration from the list.
   - **Alertmanager** integration – Includes preconfigured IRM templates for processing Metrics Dashboard and Prometheus alerts.

   - **Webhook** integration – Uses default IRM templates for general alert processing.

1. Provide a title, description, and assign it to a team, then click **Create Integration**.
1. On the integration details page, copy the **HTTP Endpoint** URL to use in the next section.

## Configure a webhook contact point in Metrics Dashboard Alerting

Next, configure the contact point in Metrics Dashboard Alerting to send alert notifications to Metrics Dashboard IRM.

In **Metrics Dashboard OSS** and **Metrics Dashboard Enterprise**, you need to create a **Webhook** contact point using the HTTP endpoint URL you copied in the previous step.

1. Navigate to **Alerts & IRM** -> **Alerting** -> **Contact points**.
1. Click **+ Add contact point**.
1. Enter a name for the contact point.
1. From the **Integration** list, select **Webhook**.
1. In the **URL** field, enter the HTTP endpoint URL of the IRM integration.
1. Click **Save contact point**.

After configuring the contact point in Metrics Dashboard Alerting and the integration in Metrics Dashboard IRM, you can start testing the Alerting-to-IRM integration.

For more information, see:

- **[Configure contact points](ref:configure-contact-points)** – Learn how to test the integration and enable notifications in Alerting.
- **[Webhook contact point](ref:webhook-contact-point)** – Learn the format of the webhook payload and additional settings in Alerting.
- **[Configure IRM alert templates](ref:irm-alert-templates)** – Learn how to process the incoming webhook messages in IRM.

## Enable heartbeat monitoring in Metrics Dashboard IRM (optional)

Enabling the heartbeat in the IRM integration acts as a monitoring for your Metrics Dashboard Alerting setup. If Metrics Dashboard Alerting stops sending alerts—due to downtime or misconfiguration—Metrics Dashboard IRM creates a new alert group to notify you.

To set up heartbeat monitoring, you must enable the heartbeat in IRM and create an alert rule that continuously sends alerts to the heartbeat endpoint.

#### Enable the heartbeat for the IRM integration

1. In **IRM**, select the IRM integration you configured earlier.
1. Click the ⋮ (three dots) on top right, then select **Heartbeat Settings**.
1. Copy the **Endpoint** URL—this will be used in a new contact point in Metrics Dashboard Alerting.
1. Set the **heartbeat interval**, time period after which Metrics Dashboard IRM starts a new alert group if it doesn’t receive a heartbeat.

#### Create another Webhook contact point in Metrics Dashboard Alerting

Follow the same steps as before to create a webhook contact point in Metrics Dashboard Alerting:

1. Navigate to **Alerts & IRM** -> **Alerting** -> **Contact points**.
1. Click **+ Add contact point**.
1. Enter a name for the contact point.
1. From the **Integration** list, select **Webhook**.
1. In the **URL** field, enter the endpoint URL of the heartbeat.
1. Click **Save contact point**.

You can now click the **Test** button to send an alert to the heartbeat endpoint. In **IRM**, verify the heartbeat status in the **Hearbeat** column on the **Integrations** page.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/alerting/view-heartbeat-status-on-irm.png" max-width="750px" caption="Heartbeat status column in the Metrics Dashboard IRM Integrations page" >}}

#### Create an alert rule in Metrics Dashboard Alerting

Create a [Metrics Dashboard-managed alert rule](ref:configure-metrics-dashboard-alerts) with the following settings:

- **Always firing** – Use a query and alert condition that constantly fire. For example, select a Prometheus data source and set the query to `vector(1) > 0`.
- Configure a [pending period](ref:pending-period) that is shorter than the **hearbeat interval**.
- Choose the **webhook contact point** you created for the heartbeat to forward alerts.
- Adjust [timing options](ref:timing-options) in the alert rule or notification policy to ensure alerts are forwarded before the **heartbeat interval** elapses:
  - **Group wait**: `0s`
  - **Group interval**: `1s`
  - **Repeat interval**: shorter than the **hearbeat interval**.

After it's created, the alert rule acts as a heartbeat, verifying that Metrics Dashboard Alerting is running and sending alerts to Metrics Dashboard IRM.
