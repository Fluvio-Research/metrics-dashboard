# Get Metrics Dashboard help

---

First, check the official [Metrics Dashboard documentation](https://metrics-dashboard.com/docs/).

If you require further help or support then ask a question in the [Metrics Dashboard community site](https://community.metrics-dashboard.com/) or [Metrics Dashboard Slack](http://slack.raintank.io/). You can also search the community site for previously answered questions, in case someone already had your problem and got help.

**Please note:**

- The Metrics Dashboard project uses GitHub mainly for tracking bugs and feature requests.
- Do not open an issue just to ask a question. The issue will be closed immediately.
- Only submit issues for bug reports, feature requests, or enhancements.
