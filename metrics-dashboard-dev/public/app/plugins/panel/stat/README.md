# Stat panel - Native Plugin

The Stat panel is **included** with Metrics Dashboard.

The Stat panel visualization shows one large statistic with an optional graph sparkline. The background or value color can be controlled using thresholds.

By default, the Stat panel displays one of the following:

- The value for a single series or field.
- The value and name for multiple series or fields.

The Text mode can be used to control whether the text is displayed or not.

The Stat panel is a replacement for the Singlestat panel, which was deprecated in Metrics Dashboard v7.0 and removed in Metrics Dashboard v8.4.
