# Annotation List Panel - Native Plugin

This Annotations List panel is **included** with Metrics Dashboard.

Using the annotations list panel, you can quickly collect, filter and access annotations for easy reference or referral.

The annotations panel can be used to show annotations present within the panels on the current dashboard, or site-wide. Additional options include the ability to limit the list of annotations based on the current time range and the tags used on the annotations.
