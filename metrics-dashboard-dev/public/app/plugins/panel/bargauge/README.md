# Bar gauge

The bar gauge simplifies your data by reducing every field to a single value. You choose how Metrics Dashboard calculates the reduction.

This panel can show one or more bar gauges depending on how many series, rows, or columns your query returns.

This Bar chart is **included** with Metrics Dashboard.
